Hi!
So, here I'd like to share my architecture, it already has UI/UX design, so operating it shouldn't be hard, right?
No, I'm not joking, it has already human-designed UI, but it runs on your CPU, I've planned to implement it on the circuit's processor, but for now, let it use your CPU.
I'm writting this so my thesis examiner wouldn't be a total jack-ass.
